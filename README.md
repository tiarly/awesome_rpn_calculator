[![forthebadge](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-ruby.svg)](http://forthebadge.com) [![forthebadge](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-love.svg)](http://forthebadge.com)

This is an attempt to solve the given imaginary problem.

Context
-----------------

We're building this command-line calculator for people who are comfortable with UNIX-like CLI utilities.
We are starting with the basic 4 operators now but will want to eventually implement other operators and
an alternate interface (such as WebSocket, file, or TCP socket).
There's no need to implement these, but design with these future changes in mind.

Specifications
-----------------

1. The calculator should use standard input and standard output
2. It should implement the four standard arithmetic operators
3. The calculator should handle errors and recover gracefully
4. The calculator should exit when it receives a `q` command or an end of input indicator (EOF / Ctrl+D)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'awesome_rpn_calculator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install awesome_rpn_calculator

## Usage
